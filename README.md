# Logistic Regression

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Logistic Regression model. The model is trained on a dataset, and predictions are made using the trained model. It includes the implementation of the cost function, gradient descent optimization, and prediction methods.

## Features

- ðŸš€ **Logistic Regression Model**: Trains the logistic regression model using gradient descent optimization.
- ðŸ”„ **Sigmoid Function**: Applies the sigmoid function element-wise to the input.
- ðŸ’¡ **Cost Function**: Computes the cost (loss) of the model with L2 regularization.
- ðŸ”§ **Gradient Descent**: Optimizes the model's parameters using gradient descent.
- ðŸ–¼ **Decision Boundary Plotting**: Visualizes the decision boundary of the logistic regression model.

## Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ErenKaradeniz0/logistic-regression.git
   cd logistic-regression
